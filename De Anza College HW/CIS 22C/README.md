# CIS 22C - Data Abstraction and Structures (C++)

Text: Data Abstraction & Problem Solving with C++: Walls and Mirrors 6th Edition (Carrano)

This class was offered either in C++ or Java. I had to take the C++ version, but the Java version used this textbook:
Data Structures and Abstractions with Java 4th Edition (Carrano)
(For practice problem purposes, the 3rd edition was used)
